Examine juvenile Chinook salmon fry emergence and presmolt emigration timing as it relates to the hydrograph in the Lemhi River

Notes on Chinook salmon emergence timing from Quinn (2005): 
The relationship between spawning date and emergence stems from the rough equivalence between time and temperature in controlling
embryonic development, and a combined unit known as 'degree days' or 'temperature units' (TUs) reflects this fact. The developmental
rate of embryos can be estimated from the product of the number of degrees Celcius above 0 times the number of days. For example, coho
salmon hatch about 500 TUs after fertilization, and this could be 50 days at 10C or 100 days at 5C.

Chinook salmon TUs appear to be within the range 404-536 (avg = 500, med = 517) days to hatch based on table 8-1 in Quinn (2005).
